Hi, 
These crop files are directly from WOFOST. 
For running simulations for any of these crops, you have to copy the whole content of file and paste it in another file ("practice_relevantcrop.crop" present in crop and agro folder) by removing the previous content.

These crop files are calibrated and validated for specific regions in Europe (I preferred to keep for Germany regions). For a specific region, you can calibrate the crop parameters based on historical yield data utilizing optimization script.
For further regions and further crops, you can access the WOFOST crop files here: https://github.com/ajwdewit/WOFOST/blob/master/cropd/bar301.cab

Thanks.
Muhammad Arslan.
